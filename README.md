# Blinky Mbed OS example for Tamarillo

The example project is forked from the [Arm Mbed OS Official Examples](https://os.mbed.com/code/) and is a work-in-progress port to Innovodesign's custom STM32F767 Tamarillo target. It contains an application that repeatedly blinks an LED on supported [Mbed boards](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/).

You can build the project with all supported [Mbed OS build tools](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/tools/index.html). However, this example project specifically refers to the command-line interface tool [Arm Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).
(Note: To see a rendered example you can import into the Arm Online Compiler, please see our [import quick start](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/online-with-the-online-compiler.html#importing-the-code).)

1. [Install Mbed CLI](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/offline-with-mbed-cli.html).

1. Clone this repository on your system, and change the current directory to where the project was cloned:

    $ cd [target folder]
    $ mbed add https://innovodesign/mbed-tamarillo-767
